Overview

Jena AI is a toolkit and runtime for building AI-powered VTubers and virtual assistants. It combines input handling, agent orchestration, multimodal outputs (voice, animation, and overlays), and flexible integration points to let creators build interactive characters.

Highlights

- Lightweight runtime and plugin-friendly architecture
- Multi-agent orchestration for role-based behaviors
- Easy integration with streaming overlays and TTS/voice systems
- Extensible: add custom agents, animations, and connectors

Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   git clone https://github.com/Saidie000/JenaAI-VTuber.git
   cd JenaAI-VTuber

2. Install dependencies (example for Node-based runtime):

   npm install

3. Ensure the logo exists at docs/assets/logo.svg (the repo will contain both logo.svg and logo.png for compatibility).
   - I include an SVG wrapper that references the existing logo.png so raster content remains the same while you get an .svg entrypoint for site tooling.

4. Configure your environment (see docs/usage.md and docs/getting-started.md)

Usage

See docs/usage.md for examples, configuration, and CLI instructions.
